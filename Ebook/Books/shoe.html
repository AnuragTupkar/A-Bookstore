          <h1>DAWN</h1>
          I was up before the others, before the birds, before the sun. I drank a cup of
          coffee, wolfed down a piece of toast, put on my shorts and sweatshirt, and
          laced up my green running shoes. Then slipped quietly out the back door.
          I stretched my legs, my hamstrings, my lower back, and groaned as I took
          the first few balky steps down the cool road, into the fog. Why is it always so
          hard to get started?
          There were no cars, no people, no signs of life. I was all alone, the world
          to myself—though the trees seemed oddly aware of me. Then again, this was
          Oregon. The trees always seemed to know. The trees always had your back.
          What a beautiful place to be from, I thought, gazing around. Calm, green,
          tranquil—I was proud to call Oregon my home, proud to call little Portland
          my place of birth. But I felt a stab of regret, too. Though beautiful, Oregon
          struck some people as the kind of place where nothing big had ever
          happened, or was ever likely to. If we Oregonians were famous for anything,
          it was an old, old trail we’d had to blaze to get here. Since then, things had
          been pretty tame.
          The best teacher I ever had, one of the finest men I ever knew, spoke of
          that trail often. It’s our birthright, he’d growl. Our character, our fate—our
          DNA. “The cowards never started,” he’d tell me, “and the weak died along
          the way—that leaves us.”
          Us. Some rare strain of pioneer spirit was discovered along that trail, my
          teacher believed, some outsized sense of possibility mixed with a diminished
          capacity for pessimism—and it was our job as Oregonians to keep that strain
          alive.
          I’d nod, showing him all due respect. I loved the guy. But walking away
          I’d sometimes think: Jeez, it’s just a dirt road.
          That foggy morning, that momentous morning in 1962, I’d recently
          blazed my own trail—back home, after seven long years away. It was strange
          being home again, strange being lashed again by the daily rains. Stranger
          still was living again with my parents and twin sisters, sleeping in my
          childhood bed. Late at night I’d lie on my back, staring at my college
          textbooks, my high school trophies and blue ribbons, thinking: This is me?
          Still?
          I moved quicker down the road. My breath formed rounded, frosty puffs,
          swirling into the fog. I savored that first physical awakening, that brilliant
          moment before the mind is fully clear, when the limbs and joints first begin
          to loosen and the material body starts to melt away. Solid to liquid.
          Faster, I told myself. Faster.
          On paper, I thought, I’m an adult. Graduated from a good college—‐
          University of Oregon. Earned a master’s from a top business school—
          Stanford. Survived a yearlong hitch in the U.S. Army—Fort Lewis and Fort
          Eustis. My résumé said I was a learned, accomplished soldier, a twenty-fouryear-old man in full . . . So why, I wondered, why do I still feel like a kid?
          Worse, like the same shy, pale, rail-thin kid I’d always been.
          Maybe because I still hadn’t experienced anything of life. Least of all its
          many temptations and excitements. I hadn’t smoked a cigarette, hadn’t tried
          a drug. I hadn’t broken a rule, let alone a law. The 1960s were just under
          way, the age of rebellion, and I was the only person in America who hadn’t
          yet rebelled. I couldn’t think of one time I’d cut loose, done the unexpected.
          I’d never even been with a girl.
          If I tended to dwell on all the things I wasn’t, the reason was simple.
          Those were the things I knew best. I’d have found it difficult to say what or
          who exactly I was, or might become. Like all my friends I wanted to be
          successful. Unlike my friends I didn’t know what that meant. Money?<br>
